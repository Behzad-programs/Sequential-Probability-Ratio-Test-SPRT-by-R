# Sequential-Probability-Ratio-Test-SPRT-by-R
In this project, a function called sprt is presented which has performed statistical testing of a simple hypothesis ( 𝐻0) versus another simple hypothesis ( 𝐻1) using the SPRT method. Also, another function called en.sprt is designed to estimate the number of sampling steps for accepting 𝐻0 or accepting 𝐻1. You can read all explanations and codes in the the 'SPRT-Behzad.pdf'.
