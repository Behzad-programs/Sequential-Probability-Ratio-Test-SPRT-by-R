# Sequential-Probability-Ratio-Test-SPRT-by-R
In this project, a function called sprt is presented which has performed statistical testing of a simple hypothesis ( 𝐻0) versus another simple hypothesis ( 𝐻1) using the SPRT method. Also, another function called en.sprt is designed to estimate the number of sampling steps for accepting 𝐻0 or accepting 𝐻1.
